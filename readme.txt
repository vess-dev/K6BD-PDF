There is no good compiled PDF for K6BD that doesn't also have the hover text, or the entries.
This script compiles the images, then the hover text, then the entry text into a PDF.
It optionally can run it through TinyPNG if provided an API key and a boolean is toggled.

You can find the compiled PDFs here.
