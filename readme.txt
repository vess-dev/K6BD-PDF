There is no good compiled PDF for K6BD that doesn't also have the 1. hover text and 2. the entries.
This script compiles the images, and the hover text, and the entry text into a PDF.
It optionally can also run the images through TinyPNG if provided an API key and if a flag is toggled.

You can find the compiled PDFs here.
